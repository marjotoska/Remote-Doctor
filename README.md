# Summary
**A web-app built in MEN stack ('MERN' without 'R') during COVID-19 pandemic.** Started out as a throwaway project to practice web development skills, then became my Bachelor's thesis after putting 4 months work into it :grin:.

This project consists of an informative landing page, Login/Signup form *(saved in MongoDB Atlas:leaves:)*, upload image panel:monkey: and a Real-Time Chat feature:speech_balloon: *(built using Socket.io)*. 
Users can also communicate via video-calls on an open-source platform
called Jitsi by clicking a button that generates a random link that is part of the chat interface.

You can find it live at: [this link](https://marjotoska.github.io/Remote-Doctor)

### Purpose of this project
The thought of creating this application popped up in my head during the CoVID-19 Outbreak. I was thinking of a way that patients could still get a doctor visit during the pandemic, but in the meantime eliminate the risk of contracting the virus.

### Note
*For the login/signup, chat or other activities that need any kind of sign-in, I have to start my local server.*
